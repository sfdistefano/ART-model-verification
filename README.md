# Verification of the Automated Reference Toolset (ART)
#### The code and index inputs in this repository were used in my masters thesis at New Mexico State University, defended in December 2018. 

The ART was created by USGS scientists Travis Nauman and Mike Duniway (doi:10.2136/sssaj2016.05.0151). 
My main interest was to test for its possible use in generating reference sites for oil and gas reclamation on public land managed 
by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the US. The study was conducted in the BLM White River Field Office in an area south of Rangely, CO.

### Extra notes:
* The wetness index and slope files are not included in the repository because of GitHub size limits. 
In addition, the vegetation monitoring data collected by the private company Utah Gas Corp is not available for privacy reasons.
* I created a R "cheatsheet" to go through the basics of using the ART model named "ART_cheatsheet.pptx" which can be found within this repository.
